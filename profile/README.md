# Aurora Rocketry Team
Aurora Rocketry is a non profit organization based in Forl√¨. Our primary goal is cultivating skilled and passionate engineers that can work together as a team.
We aim to do so by researching, designing and building rockets and rocket engines to take part in student competitions around Europe and, of course, having fun doing so.

The Team was founded by a group of students in November of 2023 and is now recruting motivated students from all the campus faculties that want to take part in the first project ever.
